Dukana-Dillo-Maikona peace declaration was first support by the Kenya National Steering Committee (NSC) in 20009.  The declaration was a cross border solutions to the prolonged community conflict between Boranas of Ethiopia and Gabras of Kenya.  As a result of this declaration, the conflict was mitigated to a great extend enabling the two communities live together, share grazing and watering resources , opened cross border trade and enabled education and health services sharing especially on the Kenyan side.  However, with the introduction of a USAID funded program dabbed PEACE III, in partnership with Strategies for Northern Development (SND) and Inter African Group (AIG), the two communities identified the need to revise the declaration and its amendment due to the prevailing circumstances identified as inconsistencies, ambiguity and double punishment inflicted on suspect.  The parties, in one of PEACE III activities suggested the need to review some key clauses such as age specification of cattle that is used for blood compensation.  On May 31, 2017 at Koet-Borana Hotel Moyale- Ethiopia, PEACE III and its partners facilitated a community meeting that reviewed and mended the Dukana-Dillo-Maikona Declaration. This meeting gave forth the reviews and amendments on the Dukana-Dillo-Maikona declaration peace process which PEACE III helped document and is here presented for validation.
